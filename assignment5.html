        <h3 style="padding: 2px;">Circuit Diagram</h3>
        <img src="images/a5-motors-diagram.png" width=700>
        <p>Both the servo motor and joystick are connected to the same 5V power source on the Arduino. On the joystick
            (diagram), "VERT" and "HORIZ" are
            both analog. "SEL" is digital. I don't need a switch so I didn't connect "SEL." These labels are different
            on the component that I have in my kit however, instead of "VERT", "HORIZ", and "SEL", the following are
            respectively interchangable: "VRx", "VRy", and "SW"</p>
        <h3>Schematic</h3>
        <img src="images/a5-motors-schematic.png" width=500>
        <p>The servo changes position based on the direction in which the joystick is pressed. The range of changes in
            position for the servo is 0 degrees to 180 degrees. According to the servo's DATA SHEET, it takes
            0.1 seconds to move 60 degrees. The minimum delay it would take for the servo to get
            to the desired position. I used the biggest difference in position: 0 degrees to 180 degrees. (60
            degrees / 0.1 seconds) = (180 degrees / x seconds) so x = 0.3 seconds. So I used delay(300).</p>
        <h3>Joystick Values</h3>
        <img src="images/a5-joystick-positions.png" width=500>
        <p>The Arduino's DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter) has a resolution of 10 bits, meaning the joystick's position
            values range from 0 to 1024. So I mapped out the x and y values of the joystick at
            different press positions.
            Transmission over the communication port has to be made with 8-bit values, while our DAC (Digital to Analog
            Converter is measuring the values from the potentiometers in the joystick) has a resolution of 10bits. This
            means that our sensors are characterized with a value between 0 and 1024.</p>
        <h3>Serial Monitor Output Sample</h3>
        <img src="images/a5-serial-monitor-output.gif" width=500>
        <p>Serial outputâ€”values change based on where the joystick is being pressed.</p>
