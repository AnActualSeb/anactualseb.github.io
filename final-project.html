      <h2>Project Concept</h2>
      <p>
        The original idea for my final project was to implement an item finder,
        using either the ultrasonic sensor or RFID sensors and receivers. I
        wasn't sure of the technical feasibility for short to middle-range
        detection of items, so I decided to pivot to a static item finder that
        could be placed in areas that items are likely to fall into and can't
        easily be found. I couldn't have finished this project without some
        Processing code help from
        <a href="https://howtomechatronics.com/tutorials/arduino/processing/"
          >HowToMechatronics</a
        >! Thank you!

      <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
      <h3>Diagram</h3>
      <p>
        The circuit is connected to 5V from the Arduino, powered by my laptop,
        and all grounds are connected. The servo motor serves as the resistor in
        this case because when I attempted adding a 1000Ω resistor or smaller,
        the servo motor would not rotate as strongly. The servo motor is
        connected to output pin 12 and the ultrasonic sensor is connected to
        input pins 11 and 12.

      <h3>Schematic</h3>
      <p>
        There was a consistent 5V of power moving through the circuit, only
        being limited by the servo motor resistor (≈3.4Ω). To reiterate, I did
        not use a resistor for this project because the servo motor essentially
        has one within it, and when testing my circuit, using a resistor of
        1000Ω or less, the servo motor would not rotate as strongly, most likely
        due to a current dampening. I attempted to measure the current using my
        multimeter but the values did not change much from the threshold of the
        servo motor alone. This is still a mystery...

    <section class="firmware">
      <h2>Firmware</h2>
      <p>
        My project's firmware consisted of a constant communication between the
        Arduino file and the Processing file. Arduino handled the hardware
        communication and outputting values to the serial monitor, which were
        picked up and interpreted by the Processing file running concurrently.
      </p>
      <h3>Arduino Code</h3>
      <p>
        The Arduino code initialized the ultrasonic sensor pins as an inputs and
        the servo motor pin as an output. The code below outputs values in the
        format of [angle1,distance1.,angle2,distance2.] that the ultrasonic
        sensor reads, to be read by the concurrent Processing code. This output
        is sent to the serial monitor, which is being listened to by the
        Processing file for changes. This code file also handles the rotation of
        the servo motor. The servo motor rotates from 15 to 165 degrees because
        of the placement that I wanted it to have, relative to the enclosure I
        put the circuit in. These values can be changed to anything between 0
        and 180 however.

      <h3>Processing Code</h3>
      <p>
        The Processing code file does the bulk of the work here and was heavily
        influenced by
        <a href="https://howtomechatronics.com/tutorials/arduino/processing/"
          >HowToMechatronics</a
        >. Even so, I can tell you what this code does. First it listens for the
        changes in the serial monitor port coming from the Arduino code output,
        and displays them when the ultrasonic sensor detects something in space.
        This code also creates the "sonar" graph, which is an evenly spaced
        semi-circle, divided into 6 evenly spaced quadrants, each spanning 30
        degrees. It also creates a conic shape that is the "scanner" or field of
        vision for what the ultrasonic sensor can sense. Lastly it creates green
        lines across the semi circle when it doesn't detect anything in space,
        and red lines when it does detect an item in space. These lines are
        created every 5ms or so based on the sine and cosine calculations that
        are used to calculate the distances and angles, based on the evenly
        spaced sections, each measuring 30 radians. The tricky part here was
        getting the widths and heights of the shapes and lines to render
        correctly. I had issues with window sizes and so the code takes that
        into account as well and uses window width and height variables to
        calculate a readable radar!

      <h2>Implementation Process & Technical Write-up</h2>
      <h3>Step 1: Create Enclosure for Breadboard + Circuit</h3>
      <p>
        I asked my roommate for help with creating a 3D-printed enclosure for
        the breadboard and circuitry of this project. We utilized AutoDesk to
        create the model and then exported the g-code for printing. The way we
        did this was to measure the dimensions of the breadboard exactly and
        then add some buffer millimeters for spacing, and extract the whole
        shape upwards for an enclosure. The tough part was getting the cutouts
        for the USB-A port and the power entry port correct with the scaling
        factor that 3D-modeling software tends to add for you.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 2: Implement Circuit</h3>
      <p>
        Next, I simply connected the necessary wires to the servo motor and the
        ultrasonic sensor and the Arduino, but NOT after reading the DATA SHEET
        for the ultrasonic sensor to learn more about it! This was the easiest
        part of the work for this project because the circuit for connecting
        these three components together is relatively trivial.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 3: Test Servo is Outputting Correct Serial Port Values</h3>
      <p>
        I should preface this step by saying that I had to mount my servo motor
        using zip ties and electrical tape to my printed enclosure in order to
        get it to a height where it wouldn't detect the table over and over
        again but rather objects at its "eye-level". Once the ultrasonic sensor
        was zip tied and mounted to the servo motor, I ran Sweep as an example
        program to test the rotation sensitivity, and then ran the Arduino file
        for my final project to make sure the serial monitor was getting the
        series of 4 values that I needed it to record.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 4: Implement Processing Code from Tutorial for Sonar Graph</h3>
      <p>
        The last bit of work was done mostly watching someone else's tutorial
        and getting some math help from trusty online resources. Getting the
        radian values right for the correct graph plot to render was key here,
        but after all the math was said and done, all that needed to happen was
        run the two programs at once so that they could communicate with each
        other, and off we go!
