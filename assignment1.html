        <p>The red LEDs I used have a voltage drop of 1.8V, and am working on the resistance calculation... I use 4 1k
            Ohm resistors in my circuit design.</p>
        <h3>Schematic</h3>
        <img src="images/a1-blink-schematic.png" width=500>
        <p>I used pins 9, 10, and 11 from the Arduino R3,, as well as a connection to ground from my laptop.</p>
        <h3>Firmware</h3>

Assignment 1: Blink!
Sebastian Torres Retana

Adapted from code tutorial (http://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Blink) by 
Scott Fitzgerald, Arturo Guadalupi, and Colby Newman

Turns on 3 LEDs on by one in sequence from left to right, short and sweeet!

// the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
void setup() {
// initialize each digital pin used as an output.

// initialize digital pin 9 as an output
pinMode(9, OUTPUT);
// initialize digital pin 10 as an output
pinMode(10, OUTPUT);
// initialize digital pin 11 as an output
pinMode(11, OUTPUT);

void loop() {
// turns on LEDs from left to right, one by one, then off, using offset delays,

// turn on LED connected to digital pin 9 by setting voltage to HIGH
digitalWrite(9, HIGH);
// wait for 2 seconds
delay(2000);
// turn off LED connected to digital pin 9 by setting voltage to LOW
digitalWrite(9, LOW);
// wait for 2 seconds
delay(2000);
// turn on LED connected to digital pin 10 by setting voltage to HIGH
digitalWrite(10, HIGH);
// wait for 1 second
delay(1000);
// turn off LED connected to digital pin 10 by setting voltage to LOW
digitalWrite(10, LOW);
// wait for 1 second
delay(1000);
// turn on LED connected to digital pin 11 by setting voltage to HIGH
digitalWrite(11, HIGH);
// wait for 500 milliseconds
