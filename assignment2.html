        <ul>
            <li>The Arduino outputs 5V</li>
            <li>The white-colored LEDs each have a forward-voltage of 3.3V</li>
            <li>Voltage moving through the circuit (V) = 5 - 3.3 = 1.7V</li>
            <li>From the data sheet, the max current of the LEDs is 20mA = 0.02A</li>
            <li>V = I x R -> R = V/I -> R = 1.7V / 0.02A = 85Ω</li>
            <li>I used 330Ω resistors because (honestly) that is what we had been using in class throughout the

Assignment 2: Lights that Fade!

3 white LEDs start off as brightly on. As soon as the button is pressed, they begin to fade.

// "global constant" initialized to 2 for the pushbutton pin
// this value will not change throughout the program
const int buttonPin = 2;

// the following variables will be changing throughout the program:
// variable for reading the pushbutton status
int buttonState = 0;
// how bright the LED is
int brightness = 0;
// how many points to fade the LED by
int fadeValue = 5;

void setup() {
// use a for-loop to initialize pins 3, 6, and 9 as outputs
for (int thisPin = 3; thisPin < 10; thisPin+=3) {
    pinMode(thisPin, OUTPUT);
}
    
// initialize the pushbutton pin (global constant) as an input
pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT);
}

void loop() {
// read the state of the pushbutton value
buttonState = digitalRead(buttonPin);

// check if the pushbutton is pressed. If it is, the buttonState is HIGH (on):
if (buttonState == HIGH) {

    // use a for-loop to turn each LED on (pins 6-9)
    for (int thisPin = 3; thisPin < 10; thisPin+=3) {
    digitalWrite(thisPin, HIGH);
    }

    // use another for-loop to set the brightness of each LED (pins 6-9)
    for (int thisPin = 3; thisPin < 10; thisPin+=3) {
    analogWrite(thisPin, brightness);
    }

    // update the brightness value for the next time the above for-loop is executed
    brightness = brightness + fadeValue;
    
    // reverse the direction of the brightness at the end of the fading effect
    // checking each end of the brightness values (top and bottom), then inverting them
    if (brightness <= 0 || brightness >= 255) {
    fadeValue = -fadeValue;
    }
    
    // wait for 10 milliseconds to see the dimming effect
    delay(10);
    
}
// otherwise, if the buttonState is LOW (off), turn the LEDs on
else {

    // again, using a for-loop to turn each LED in pins 6-9 on
